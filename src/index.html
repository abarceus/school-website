 <h4>Deputy Prime Minister - Harshal Visaria's Speech</h4>
  <br><img src="images\harshal.jpg" style="width:300px;Height:400px" />
  <div style ="font-size:17px;"> 
<p>&#34;Good Morning respected teachers, students, staff and the Special guests. It is overwhelming to be standing in front of you. I am Harshal Visaria. Being the Deputy Prime Minister of around 2500 students each with great potential, is a privilege. Every human being has multiple roles to play in life. A person of my age can be a sibling, a daughter or a son, and a friend. I am honoured to have another identity of the Deputy Prime Minister. And this is only possible because of your support. I thank you for having faith in me and electing me as your Deputy PM.</p> 
<p>To those of you, who did not get elected at this juncture do not feel disheartened but use this opportunity to develop experience and seek different avenues of leadership.
Leadership to me is having a vision that is well communicated and taking effective action.</p>
<p> Leadership is practised not so much in words as in actions.</p>
<p>No one has all the answers or can do all the work. Remember, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</p>
<p>The future depends on our ability to work together. Co-operation and team work will get us far.</p>
<p>So let us begin the journey today, of making this school the very best it can be. Thank you.&#34;</p>
<p> - Harshal Visaria, Dep PM 2016-17</p>

<h4>Prime Minister - Aayush Ramachandran's Speech</h4>
<br><img src="images\aayush.jpg" style="width:300px;Height:400px" />
<div style ="font-size:17px;">
<p>&#34; Good Morning!</p> <p>First of all a big thank you to all of you for having reposed your faith and trust in me. I shall endeavour to live up not only to your trust but also to all your expectations.</p>
<p> So what is it that I propose for you?</p>
<p> Take a twig, break it, it splits into two. Now take a bunch of twigs, tie them with a string. Now try to break it. It won&#39;t break. So, big deal. We all know, in unity there is strength. </p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s not the point I am trying to make. What I am saying is that all Shishuvanites are the bunch of twigs and I am going to function as the string that keeps and bind us together.</p> 
<p>No matter what your problems are, no matter what your grievances be, feel free to approach me and I shall do my best to resolve the same.</p>
<p> I promise you, together we will make this a happening year. </p>
<p>Thank you. &#34 </p>
<p> - Aayush Ramchandran, PM 2016-17</p>

<h4>Prime Minister - Bhumika Shah's Speech</h4>
<br><img src="images\bhumika.jpg" style="width:300px;Height:400px" />
<div style ="font-size:17px;">
<p>&#34; I whole heartedly thank all of you for giving me the opportunity to represent and serve you all.</p>
<p> I believe that is important for us to be persistent and never give up. Participate, explore, unlearn, and learn. My clear motive is to deliver up to my fullest capacity. </p>
<p>As I firmly believe that &#39; actions speak louder than words &#39;, I will keep up to that.</p>
<p> Lastly, I hope that we have an exciting, entertaining and memorable journey this year. &#34; - Bhumika, Dep PM 2016-17</p>
